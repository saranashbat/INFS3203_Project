**Introduction**

In response to Qatar's evolving job market and the goals outlined in the Qatar National Development Strategy (QNDS), this project aims to address the challenges individuals face when seeking employment opportunities in the country. With a focus on streamlining the job search process and providing individuals with the necessary tools and information, this project proposes the development of a user-friendly job search application. This application aims to provide comprehensive job listings, essential qualifications, and relevant company information, thereby facilitating efficient job matching and fostering workforce advancement. This project seeks to make a meaningful contribution to Qatar's economic growth and development objectives, ultimately shaping a future-ready workforce and supporting the nation's journey towards prosperity.

**Qatar National Development Strategy**

This project directly addresses a need identified by the Qatar National Development Strategy, which is fostering a future-ready workforce and advancing economic diversification. By providing a centralized platform for job seekers to access information on available employment opportunities, required qualifications, and relevant companies, this project aims to streamline the job search process. This initiative aligns closely with the QNDS goals of promoting economic growth and development by empowering individuals with the tools and resources necessary to secure suitable employment. Additionally, by facilitating efficient job matching and fostering workforce advancement, our project contributes to the broader objectives outlined in the QNDS, ultimately supporting Qatar's vision of sustainable growth and prosperity.


**Identification of Need**

In Qatar's rapidly evolving job market, individuals often face challenges when searching for available employment opportunities. With the country's goals of economic growth and development outlined in the Qatar National Development Strategy, there is a need to simplify the job search process and provide individuals with the necessary tools and information to secure suitable employment. Many job seekers struggle to find relevant job listings, understand the required skills and qualifications, and identify potential employers in their desired field. This highlights the need for a user-friendly job search platform that provides comprehensive information on job categories, required skills, and relevant companies, thereby facilitating the job search process and fostering workforce advancement in alignment with Qatar's development objectives.

**Project Proposal**

This project aims to address a problem that many students in Qatar face after graduating: finding employment opportunities. In addition, it aims to facilitate the process of finding employment for foreign individuals looking to work in Qatar. The proposed project is a job search application that lists a variety of relevant job categories in Qatar with information about available jobs within each category, such as required qualifications, years of experience, work environment (fully remote, hybrid, or on-site), and salary ranges. Applying for jobs will be possible directly through the application, making the process of applying for jobs more efficient. This application will simplify the process of searching for jobs by providing a centralized resource for information about job fields and employers in Qatar. The goals of this proposed application align with Qatar's National Development Strategy, as this application will help create a future-ready workforce which will ultimately help Qatar's economic growth. 


**Potential Impact**

The proposed job search application offers a straightforward solution to simplify the employment process in Qatar. By providing users with a user-friendly interface that offers comprehensive information on job categories, necessary skills, certifications, and relevant companies, we aim to simplify the job search experience. This initiative not only helps individuals in securing suitable employment but also aligns with Qatar's development objectives of cultivating a skilled workforce and attracting talent. Consequently, the application stands as a promising tool to contribute to Qatar's economic growth and development by facilitating efficient job matching and fostering workforce advancement.
