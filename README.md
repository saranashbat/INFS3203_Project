**Identification of Need**

As a students after graduation we need to start searching for jobs by asking friends families and start searching all over the internet this can take years to find the needed job so instead we can open an app that combines all the companies together with different aspects and majors to cover all the alumni needs.


**Project Proposal**

This project aims to address a problem that many students in Qatar face after graduating: finding employment opportunities. In addition, it aims to facilitate the process of finding employment for foreign individuals looking to work in Qatar. The proposed project is a job search application that lists a variety of relevant job categories in Qatar with information about available jobs within each category, such as required qualifications, years of experience, work environment (fully remote, hybrid, or on-site), and salary ranges. Applying for jobs will be possible directly through the application, making the process of applying for jobs more efficient. This application will simplify the process of searching for jobs by providing a centralized resource for information about job fields and employers in Qatar. The goals of this proposed application align with Qatar's National Development Strategy, as this application will help create a future-ready workforce which will ultimately help Qatar's economic growth. 


**Potential Impact**

The proposed job search application offers a straightforward solution to simplify the employment process in Qatar. By providing users with a user-friendly interface that offers comprehensive information on job categories, necessary skills, certifications, and relevant companies, we aim to simplify the job search experience. This initiative not only helps individuals in securing suitable employment but also aligns with Qatar's development objectives of cultivating a skilled workforce and attracting talent. Consequently, the application stands as a promising tool to contribute to Qatar's economic growth and development by facilitating efficient job matching and fostering workforce advancement.
